Simple program for synchronising folders. 

Current capabilities:

- One-way and two-way file syncing

In progress:

- Handling syncing between folders containing files with the same name but different content.
- Simple and accessible UI

Long-term goals:

- Version control
- Greater control over what files are being synced
- Merging folders into one
- Ability to back up an entire storage device such as a USB without duplicates if files already exist on the destination device. Essentially syncing but on a larger scale.
