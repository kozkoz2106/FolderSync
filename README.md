Simple program for synchronising folders. 

Commands: 
    - push: Pushes files from one folder to another. 
    - clone: Copies all files from one folder to another. 

    Functionally the two are the same because before working on the project. I'm still figuring out how I can differentiate them or whether I should just get rid of one. 

    Planning to make this a desktop app for Mac. A version for Windows will come later.
